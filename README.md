# 🧠 Obesity Level Prediction using Machine Learning & Deep Learning

This project builds and evaluates multiple Machine Learning and Deep Learning models to predict obesity levels based on individual eating habits and physical conditions. The dataset is sourced from the [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/544/estimation+of+obesity+levels+based+on+eating+habits+and+physical+condition).
